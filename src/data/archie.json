In the morning, he checks the Transit app on his phone to see when the next bus will arrive. Today, the app predicts the bus will come in 10 minutes. He knows he has a few minutes before leaving his apartment.\n\nMost of the time, the prediction is accurate. But some days, it changes. He checks the app five minutes later, and sees the predicted arrival time has increased to 12 minutes.\n\nHe decides to walk to campus instead.\n\n“I’d say 20 percent of the time, [the prediction] gets pushed back.” Hansalia said. “It’s annoying.” \n\nDelays such as these are common for those who plan their schedules around taking the bus. Particularly near campus and on Shattuck Avenue, the wait time for the next bus is sometimes  unpredictable.\n\nInstead of publishing a schedule for each stop on each bus route, AC Transit recommends passengers rely on “real-time” predictions provided by NextBus, a company that partners with transit agencies to provide transit information. AC Transit collects GPS data from its buses and sends the information to NextBus, which predicts departure times for each stop, taking into account historical traffic patterns, according to the NextBus website. \n\nNextBus’s predictions are available on AC Transit’s website, the NextBus app and the Transit app."},{"type":"image","filename":"nextbus","caption":"A screenshot of the NextBus app. Here, the 51B bus to Berkeley Amtrak is predicted to depart from the stop on Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue in 2 minutes."},{"type":"text","text":"\nSince most stops don’t have a published schedule, in order to analyze the predictability of bus arrivals, we measured the gap between when the NextBus service <em>says</em> a bus is 20 minutes from a stop and when it <em>actually</em> arrives (according to the service). \n\nLet’s say you’re at the Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue bus stop."},{"type":"ai2html","filename":"demo"},{"type":"text","text":"\nUsing this approach, The Daily Californian analyzed which stops and lines have the least predictable arrival times. We monitored more than 45 thousand trips for 11 bus routes at 91 stops near campus in September and October.\n\nBelow, each chart shows a selection of 100 trips on a given route, along with the proportion that arrived more than five minutes later than predicted. Each arc represents one bus trip, starting 20 minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive."},{"type":"ai2html","filename":"small-multiples"},{"type":"text","text":"\nIn the time period that we monitored, almost one third of the predicted arrivals for the F toward San Francisco were off by more than five minutes. The 18 toward Lake Merritt BART was relatively unpredictable as well.\n\nOther buses, such as the 7 toward Berkeley BART, arrived as predicted more often. The 51B toward Berkeley Amtrak arrived more than five minutes later than predicted only 5 percent of the time. \n\nThe spread in delay time varied, too. Arrivals for the 7 toward El Cerrito Del Norte were tightly clustered, but the 52 toward UC Village, while rarely more than 5 minutes late, saw more varied delay times."},{"type":"section-header","text":"Where delays are greatest"},{"type":"text","text":"\nWe also measured the frequency of trips that leave more than 5 minutes later than predicted at each stop, and found that delays were most prevalent along Shattuck Avenue southbound and Piedmont Avenue southbound.

Currently, the location of AC Transit buses is recorded and sent to the NextBus service about every two minutes, according to A.J. Martin, a transportation planner at AC Transit. Soon, an upgrade to the tracking technology will enable AC Transit to record and transmit location data every 30 seconds, he said.\n\nAC Transit considers a bus “on time” if it arrives less than five minutes late and not more than one minute early. It aims for its buses to achieve this standard 72 percent of the time. Currently, it is not meeting that goal, according to Martin.\n\nAn internal task force meets monthly to address problematic routes, he added, and considers measures to improve timeliness. These include finding ways for buses to jump the queue at traffic lights, installing “transit-only lanes” that give buses priority and installing devices that enable buses to extend the duration of a green light."},{"type":"section-header","text":"Explore stops and routes nearby"},{"type":"text","text":"\nWe recorded predicted and actual departure times at stops nearby campus for 11 lines from 5 a.m. to midnight.
