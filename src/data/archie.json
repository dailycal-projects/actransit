Particularly nearby campus and on Shattuck Ave, there are many long waits for the bus to arrive. The main culprit appears to be traffic, which can come to a standstill on busy hours. The Daily Californian investigated the frequency and period of bus delays at stops surrounding campus.\n\nAC Transit publishes a schedule for stops considered “important landmarks along the route,” according to its website. For example, the schedule for <span class=\"badge badge-51B\">51B</span><span class=\"db\">Berkeley Amtrak</span> provides times for five stops along that route. However, the majority of stops don’t have departure schedules posted at the stop or online.\n\nInstead, AC Transit recommends passengers rely on “real-time” predictions provided by NextBus, a company that partners with transit agencies to provide transit information Their technology tracks buses with GPS and predicts their arrival times at each stop, taking into account historical traffic patterns, according to their website. \n\nThe prediction service is available on ACTransit’s website and NextBus app. (Some apps, such as Transit, appear to pull their data directly from NextBus.)"},{"type":"section-header","text":"Defining ‘on-time performance’"},{"type":"text","text":"\nSince most stops don’t have a published schedule, in order to measure bus delays, The Daily Californian measured the time difference between when the NextBus service says a bus is 30 minutes from a stop and when it actually arrives (according to the service). \n\nLet us say you are at the Bancroft Way & Telegraph Ave bus stop."},{"type":"ai2html","filename":"demo"},{"type":"ai2html","filename":"demo-small"},{"type":"text","text":"\nEach arc represents one bus trip, starting 30 minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive.

Others, such as 51B Berkeley Amtrak and 36 West Oakland BART, are more reliably on time.\n\nAverage delay also varies, as F Berkeley experiences close to no delays, on average, while the F San Francisco in the other direction averages several minutes late. More on methodology is explained at the end of this article."},{"type":"section-header","text":"Where delays are greatest"},{"type":"text","text":"\nStops, not just routes, have variation in delay.
