In the morning, he checks the Transit app on his phone to see when the next bus arrives. Today, the app predicts the bus will arrive at his stop in 10 minutes. He knows he has a few minutes before leaving his apartment.\n\nMost days, the prediction is accurate. The bus does arrive in 10 minutes. But some days, the the prediction can change. \"I’d say 20 percent of the time, it get pushed back and it’s annoying,\" Sahil said. After checking the app five minutes later, he sees that the prediction has actually updated and increased to 12 minutes. He decides to walk instead.\n\nDelays like these are an inevitable experience for those who make plans around the bus. Particularly nearby campus and on Shattuck Ave, there are many long waits for the bus to arrive. The main culprit appears to be traffic, which can come to a standstill on busy hours. The Daily Californian investigated the frequency and period of bus delays at stops surrounding campus.\n\nAC Transit publishes a schedule for a subset of stops along a route. For example, the <span class=\"badge badge-51B\">51B</span><span class=\"db\">Berkeley Amtrak</span> has scheduled times for five stops along that route. The remaining stops, however, do not have this information.\n\nInstead, AC Transit recommends passengers rely on “real-time” predictions provided by NextBus, a company that partners with transit agencies to provide transit information. AC Transit collects GPS data from its buses and sends the information to NextBus, which predicts their departure times at each stop, taking into account historical traffic patterns, according to their website. \n\nThe prediction service is available on AC Transit’s website and NextBus app. The Transit app shows real-time data on AC Transit buses directly from NextBus."},{"type":"section-header","text":"Defining ‘on-time performance’"},{"type":"text","text":"\nSince most stops don’t have a published schedule, in order to measure bus delays, The Daily Californian measured the time difference between when the NextBus service says a bus is 30 minutes from a stop and when it actually arrives (according to the service). \n\nLet us say you are at the Bancroft Way & Telegraph Ave bus stop."},{"type":"ai2html","filename":"demo"},{"type":"d3-graphic","id":"methodology"},{"type":"text","text":"\nEach arc represents one bus trip, starting 30 minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive.
