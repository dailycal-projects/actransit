In the morning, he checks the Transit app on his phone to see when the next bus will arrive. Today, the app predicts the bus will arrive at his stop in 10 minutes. He knows he has a few minutes before leaving his apartment.\n\nMost days, the prediction is accurate. But some days, it changes.\n\n\"I’d say 20 percent of the time, it get pushed back and it’s annoying,\" Hansalia said.\n\nAfter checking the app five minutes later, he sees the prediction has increased to 12 minutes. He decides to walk to campus instead.\n\nDelays like these are common for those who plan their schedules around taking the bus. Particularly near campus and on Shattuck Avenue, there are longer-than-expected wait times for the bus to arrive.\n\n\nInstead of publishing a schedule for each stop on each bus route, AC Transit recommends passengers rely on “real-time” predictions provided by NextBus, a company that partners with transit agencies to provide transit information. AC Transit collects GPS data from its buses and sends the information to NextBus, which predicts departure times for  each stop, taking into account historical traffic patterns, according to the NextBus website. \n\nThe prediction service is available on AC Transit’s website and the NextBus app. The Transit app shows the same predictions."},{"type":"image","filename":"nextbus","caption":"A screenshot of the NextBus app. Here, the 51B bus to Berkeley Amtrak is predicted depart from the stop on Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue in 2 minutes.","credit":"<em>Credit: Seokhyeon Ryu.</em>"},{"type":"section-header","text":"Measuring delays"},{"type":"text","text":"\nSince most stops don’t have a published schedule, in order to analyze bus delays, The Daily Californian measured the gap between when the NextBus service says a bus is 20 minutes from a stop and when it actually arrives (according to the service). \n\nLet us say you are at the Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue bus stop."},{"type":"ai2html","filename":"demo"},{"type":"d3-graphic","id":"methodology"},{"type":"text","text":"\nEach arc represents one bus trip, starting 20 minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive.

Currently, the location of AC Transit buses is recorded and sent to the NextBus service about every two minutes, according to A.J. Martin, a transportation planner at AC Transit. Soon, an upgrade to the tracking technology will enable AC Transit to record and transmit location data every 30 seconds, he said.\n\nAC Transit considers a bus “on time” if it arrives less than five minutes late and not more than one minute early. It aims for its buses to achieve this standard 72 percent of the time. Currently, it is not meeting that goal, according to Martin.\n\nAn internal task force meets monthly to address problematic routes, he added, and considers measures to improve timeliness. These include finding ways for buses to jump the queue at traffic lights, installing “transit-only lanes” that give buses priority and installing devices that enable buses to extend the duration of a green light."}]}
